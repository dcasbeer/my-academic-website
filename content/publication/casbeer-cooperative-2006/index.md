abstract: The objective of this paper is to explore the feasibility of using multiple
  low-altitude, short endurance (LASE) unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) to cooperatively
  monitor and track the propagation of large forest fires. A real-time algorithm is
  described for tracking the perimeter of fires with an on-board infrared sensor.
  Using this algorithm, we develop a decentralized multiple-UAV approach to monitoring
  the perimeter of a fire. The UAVs are assumed to have limited communication and
  sensing range. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated in simulation using
  a six degree-of-freedom dynamic model for the UAV and a numerical propagation model
  for the forest fire. Salient features of the approach include the ability to monitor
  a changing fire perimeter, the ability to systematically add and remove UAVs from
  the team, and the ability to supply time-critical information to fire fighters.
