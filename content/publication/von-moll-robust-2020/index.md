abstract: 'Analysis of the pursuit–evasion differential game consisting of multiple
  pursuers and single evader with simple motion is difficult due to the well-known
  curse of dimensionality. Policies have been proposed for this scenario, and we show
  that these policies are global Stackelberg equilibrium strategies. However, we also
  show that they are not saddle-point equilibria in the feedback sense. The argument
  is twofold: cases where the saddle-point condition is violated and cases where the
  strategy profiles are not time consistent (subgame perfect). The issue of capturability
  is explored, and sufficient conditions for guaranteed capture are provided. A new
  pursuit policy is proposed which guarantees capture while also providing an upper
  bound for capture time. The evader policy corresponding to the global Stackelberg
  equilibrium is shown to provide a lower bound for capture time. Thus, these policies
  are robust from the pursuer and evader perspectives, respectively, should they implement
  them. Several other interesting pursuit and evasion policies are explored and compared
  with the robust policies in a series of experiments.'
