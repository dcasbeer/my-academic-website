abstract: Providing persistent intelligence, reconnaissance, and surveillance of targets
  is a challenging, but important task when time-critical information is required.
  In this letter, we provide a decentralized routing algorithm for coordinating multiple
  autonomous vehicles as they visit a discrete set of pre-defined targets with weighted
  revisit priorities. The algorithm utilizes a block coordinate ascent algorithm combined
  with a Monte Carlo tree search to tractably decide each vehicle's route. The result
  is a non-myopic algorithm for multiple vehicles that is decentralized, computationally
  tractable, and allows for target prioritization. Guarantees are provided that all
  targets will have finite revisit times and that the block coordinate ascent algorithm
  will converge to a block optimal solution. Numerical simulations illustrate the
  utility of this method by showing that the results are comparable to those of a
  centralized exhaustive search and that they degrade gracefully with limited communication
  and scale under increasing numbers of targets and vehicles.
