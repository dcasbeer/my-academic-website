 abstract = {In this note the active target defense scenario is analyzed. This entails a Target aircraft being pursued by an Attacker missile while a Defender missile is launched by the Target or by a Target-friendly platform to intercept the Attacker missile. The missiles are modeled using first order dynamics and implement Pure Pursuit guidance laws but are subject to turning rate constraints. The Targetâ€™s optimal heading is obtained such that the Defender intercepts the Attacker and the terminal Target/Attacker separation is maximized. This work offers more realistic results compared to previous work where simple motion kinematics were used, that is, it was assumed that the missiles are able to turn infinitely fast.},
