abstract: Multi-agent systems' cooperation to achieve global goals is usually limited
  by sensing, actuation, and communication issues. At the local level, continuous
  measurement and actuation is only approximated by the use of digital mechanisms
  that measure and process information in order to compute and update new control
  input values at discrete time instants. Interaction with other agents takes place,
  in general, through a digital communication channel with limited bandwidth where
  transmission of continuous-time signals is not possible. This technical note considers
  the problem of consensus (or synchronization of state trajectories) of multi-agent
  systems that are described by general linear dynamics and are connected using undirected
  graphs. The proposed event-triggered consensus protocol not only avoids the need
  for continuous communication between agents but also provides a decentralized method
  for transmission of information in the presence of time-varying communication delays,
  where each agent decides its own broadcasting time instants based only on local
  information. This method gives more flexibility for scheduling information broadcasting
  compared to periodic and sampled-data implementations.
