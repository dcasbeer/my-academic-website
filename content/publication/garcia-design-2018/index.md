abstract: "This paper is concerned with a scenario of active target defense modeled\
  \ as a zero-sum differential game. The differential game theory as developed by\
  \ Isaacs provides the correct framework for the analysis of pursuit-evasion conflicts\
  \ and the design of optimal strategies for the players involved in the game. This\
  \ paper considers an Attacker missile pursuing a Target aircraft protected by a\
  \ Defender missile which aims at intercepting the Attacker before the latter reaches\
  \ the Target aircraft. A differential game is formulated where the two opposing\
  \ players/teams try to minimize/maximize the distance between the Target and the\
  \ Attacker at the time of interception of the Attacker by the Defender and such\
  \ time indicates the termination of the game. The Attacker aims to minimize the\
  \ terminal distance between itself and the Target at the moment of its interception\
  \ by the Defender. The opposing player/team consists of two cooperating agents:\
  \ The Target and the Defender. These two agents cooperate in order to accomplish\
  \ the two objectives: Guarantee interception of the Attacker by the Defender and\
  \ maximize the terminal Target-Attacker separation. In this paper, we provide a\
  \ complete, closed form solution of the active target defense differential game;\
  \ we synthesize closed-loop state feedback optimal strategies for the agents and\
  \ obtain the Value function of the game. We characterize the Target's escape set\
  \ and show that the Value function is continuous and continuously differentiable\
  \ over the Target's escape set, and that it satisfies the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs\
  \ equation everywhere in this set."
