abstract: This paper addresses a multisource localization problem with multiple unmanned
  aerial vehicles equipped with appropriate sensors coordinating with each other,
  wherein the sources are simultaneously emitting identical acoustic signals. Distributed
  coordinated localization algorithms based on multiple range and direction measurements
  are presented and performances are evaluated in different practically significant
  mission scenarios. Non-deterministic polynomial (NP) hardness to determine optimal
  number of unmanned aerial vehicles for a given mission scenario is discussed. Group
  coordination, tactical path, and goal replan strategies to enable efficient localization
  of single and multiple acoustic sources have been designed. The localization algorithm
  along with coordination strategy is verified in the presence of realistic error
  conditions through simulation.
