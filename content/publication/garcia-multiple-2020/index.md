abstract: In this paper an N -pursuer vs. M -evader team conflict is studied. This
  work extends classical differential game theory to simultaneously address weapon
  assignments and multi- player pursuit-evasion scenarios. Saddle-point strategies
  that provide guaranteed performance for each team regardless of the actual strategies
  implemented by the opponent are devised. The players' optimal strategies require
  the co-design of cooperative optimal assignments and optimal guidance laws. A representative
  measure of performance is employed and the Value function of the attendant game
  is obtained. It is shown that the Value function is continuously differentiable
  and that it satisfies the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equation â€” the curse of dimensionality
  is overcome and the optimal strategies are obtained. The cases of N = M and N textgreater
  M are considered. In the latter case, cooperative guidance strategies are also developed
  in order for the pursuers to exploit their numerical advantage. This work provides
  a foundation to formally analyze complex and high- dimensional conflicts between
  teams of N pursuers and M evaders by means of differential game theory.
