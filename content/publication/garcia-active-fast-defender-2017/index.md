abstract: A particular problem in aerospace control and applications is the active
  target defence differential game (ATDDG), where an attacker missile tries to capture
  a target aircraft which is significantly slower than the attacker. A third agent
  is a defender missile which is fired by the Target's wingman. The defender's mission
  is to intercept the attacker in time to enable a successful target evasion and its
  survival. The problem is naturally posed as a zero-sum DG. The target and the defender
  form a team; their objective is to determine a cooperative strategy to maximise
  the terminal separation between the target aircraft and the point where the Attacker
  missile is intercepted by the Defender missile. The Attacker is the opposition and
  its task is to devise its own strategy to minimise the same terminal distance. The
  solution of the ATDDG provides the instantaneous optimal heading angles for each
  agent playing the game in order to achieve their objectives. Most importantly, the
  agents' strategies are state feedback laws. The assumption of simple motion dynamics
  of the agents yields their optimal headings which is adequate in a beyond visual
  range engagement, as it is currently envisioned to be the pertinent operational
  scenario.
