abstract: This study introduces the technique of Genetic Fuzzy Trees (GFTs) through
  novel application to an air combat control problem of an autonomous squadron of
  Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicles (UCAVs) equipped with next-generation defensive
  systems. GFTs are a natural evolution to Genetic Fuzzy Systems, in which multiple
  cascading fuzzy systems are optimized by genetic methods. In this problem a team
  of UCAV's must traverse through a battle space and counter enemy threats, utilize
  imperfect systems, cope with uncertainty, and successfully destroy critical targets.
  Enemy threats take the form of Air Interceptors (AIs), Surface to Air Missile (SAM)
  sites, and Electronic WARfare (EWAR) stations. Simultaneous training and tuning
  a multitude of Fuzzy Inference Systems (FISs), with varying degrees of connectivity,
  is performed through the use of an optimized Genetic Algorithm (GA). The GFT presented
  in this study, the Learning Enhanced Tactical Handling Algorithm (LETHA), is able
  to create controllers with the presence of deep learning, resilience to uncertainties,
  and adaptability to changing scenarios. These resulting deterministic fuzzy controllers
  are easily understandable by operators, are of very high performance and efficiency,
  and are consistently capable of completing new and different missions not trained
  for.
