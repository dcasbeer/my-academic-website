abstract: A cooperative aircraft differential game where an Attacker missile pursues
  an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) herein called the Target is addressed. The Target
  UAV cooperates with up to two Defender missiles which are launched in order to intercept
  the Attacker before the latter reaches the Target. This is a scenario with important
  military applications where each one of the agents is an autonomous air vehicle.
  Each agent plans and corrects its course of action in order to defeat an opposing
  force while simultaneously optimizing an operational relevant cost/payoff performance
  measure. The Target and the Defenders cooperate to form a team against the Attacker.
  The results in this paper build on the solution of a three agent differential game,
  where the three players are the Target, the Attacker, and one Defender; in this
  paper, the benefits of firing a second Defender are considered. Indeed, launching
  two interceptor missiles is a standard procedure by providing redundant backup.
  Building on the solution of the one-Defender problem, it is possible to address
  a seemingly intractable problem, where the Target needs to decide which Defender(s)
  to cooperate with, in addition to obtaining the optimal headings of every player
  in the game. Given the initial positions of the players, we solve the problem of
  determining if a second Defender improves the Target/Defender(s) payoff and provide
  the optimal strategies for each of the agents involved. Finally, we address the
  game of kind (for the case of one Defender) which provides the safety regions to
  determine which side will win based on the initial state. These safety regions provides
  the Target’s area of vulnerability, and using these results, we describe the reduction
  to the Target’s vulnerability area brought by an additional Defender.
