abstract: A zero-sum pursuit-evasion differential game with three players, a Target,
  an Attacker, and a Defender, is considered. The Attacker pursues the Target aircraft,
  while the Defender strives to intercept the Attacker before he reaches the aircraft.
  In this paper, the game in the state space region where the Attacker prevails is
  analyzed. The state space region where the Target is vulnerable is characterized
  and the Attacker’s strategy for capturing the Target despite the presence of the
  Defender is derived. The players’ optimal strategies mesh with the previously obtained
  strategies in the state space region where the Active Target Defense Differential
  Game is played, and the Defender’s presence by virtue of him intercepting the Attacker
  allows the Target to escape.
