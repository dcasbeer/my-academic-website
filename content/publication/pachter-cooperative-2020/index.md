abstract: This paper considers pursuit-evasion differential games in the Euclidean
  plane where an evader is engaged by multiple pursuers and point capture is required.
  The players have simple motion (i.e., holonomic) in the manner of Isaacs, and the
  pursuers are faster than the evader. The attention of this paper is confined to
  the case where the pursuers have the same speed, and so the game‚Äôs parameter is
  that the evader/pursuers speed ratio is 0textlessŒºtextless10textlessùúátextless1textlessmath

  State feedback capture strategies and an evader strategy that yields a lower bound
  on his/her time-to-capture are devised using a geometric method. It is shown that,
  in group/swarm pursuit, when the players are in general position, capture is effected
  by one, two, or three critical pursuers, and this is irrespective of the size N(textgreater3)ùëÅ(textgreater3)textlessmath

  of the pursuit pack. Group pursuit devolves into pure pursuit by one of the pursuers
  or into a pincer movement pursuit by two or three pursuers who isochronously capture
  the evader. The critical pursuers are identified. However, these geometric method-based
  pursuit and evasion strategies are optimal only in a part of the state space where
  a strategic saddle point is obtained and the value of the differential game is established.
  As such, these strategies are suboptimal. To fully explore the differential game‚Äôs
  high-dimensional state space and get a better understanding of group pursuit, numerical
  experimentation is undertaken. The state space region where the geometric solution
  of the group pursuit differential game is the optimal solution becomes larger the
  smaller the speed ratio parameter is.
