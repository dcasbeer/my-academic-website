abstract: This technical note studies finite-time consensus problem for a team of
  networked nonlinear agents with unknown Lipschitz terms under communication constraints,
  where each agent has a limited sensing range. Because the induced interaction graph
  is typically state-dependent and dynamic, we propose a distributed nonlinear consensus
  algorithm that is capable of preserving the initial interaction patterns. By using
  tools from nonsmooth analysis, sufficient conditions are obtained such that finite-time
  consensus can be reached. An upper bound of the convergence time is derived via
  a two-step analysis. The validity of the theoretical result is shown by one simulation
  example.
