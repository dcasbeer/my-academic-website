abstract: A two-player differential game is considered where a spy infiltrates the
  region of interest and a defender pursues and tries to capture the spy before it
  leaves such region. This letter provides the complete solution of this game by characterizing
  the Barrier surface which separates the state space into the regions of win of the
  defender and the spy. In each region the optimal strategies that guarantee the prescribed
  outcome are provided. This is in contrast to recent results addressing the same
  problem where the proposed strategies do not guarantee capture of the spy by the
  defender when initially this outcome was prescribed by the game of kind solution.
