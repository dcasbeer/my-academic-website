abstract: This paper presents a framework for multi-agent cooperative decision making
  under communication constraints. Piece-wise optimal decentralized allocation of
  tasks for a group of unmanned aerial vehicles is considered. Each vehicle estimates
  the position of all teammates in order to assign tasks based on these estimates,
  and it also implements event-based broadcasting strategies that allow the group
  of agents to use communication resources more efficiently. The agents implement
  a simple decentralized auction scheme in order to resolve possible conflicts. This
  framework is extended to re-plan assignments when a sequence of tasks is disrupted
  by wind disturbance. Further, the effects of wind disturbance are also included
  in the task assignment process by assuming a fixed steady wind value. The overall
  framework provides a robust and communication-efficient approach for decentralized
  task allocation in the presence of communication constraints and external uncertainties.
