abstract: An interest in border defense, surveillance, and interdiction has recently
  increased for a variety of reasons related to issues of illegal immigration, terrorism,
  drug and human trafficking, and other potential threats. Unmanned aerial vehicles
  (UAVs) offer an attractive alternative to supporting and defending various threats
  at borders. This paper applies a differential game to define a border defense scenario
  where one UAV (pursuer) seeks to capture two intruders (evaders) before they reach
  a designated border. The evaders can be UAVs, marine or ground vehicles, or human
  agents, but they have a lower maximum speed than the pursuer throughout the game.
  Simple motion is assumed for the pursuer and evaders with complete state information
  shared across all agents. The game is played within a rectangular area with a parallel
  top and bottom border of length ùêøLtextlessmath display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"
  altimg=\"eq-00001.gif\"textgreatertextlessmrowtextgreatertextlessmitextgreaterLtextless/mitextgreatertextless/mrowtextgreatertextless/mathtextgreater
  and left and right borders with a length of ùëäWtextlessmath display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"
  altimg=\"eq-00002.gif\"textgreatertextlessmrowtextgreatertextlessmitextgreaterWtextless/mitextgreatertextless/mrowtextgreatertextless/mathtextgreater,
  for a game aspect ratio of ùêø/ùëäL/Wtextlessmath display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"

  The value of the game is the minimum distance to the bottom border achieved by the
  evaders at any time before capture of both evaders. Within the region where the
  pursuer wins, the game of degree is explored and the optimal policy for both the
  evaders and pursuer is derived using geometric properties.
