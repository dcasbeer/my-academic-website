abstract: This paper considers a cooperative vehicle routing problem for an intelligence,
  surveillance, and reconnaissance mission in the presence of communication constraints
  between the vehicles. The proposed framework uses a ground vehicle and an unmanned
  aerial vehicle (UAV) that travel cooperatively and visit a set of targets while
  satisfying the communication constraints. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer
  linear program, and a branch-and-cut algorithm is developed to solve the problem
  to optimality. Furthermore, a transformation method and a heuristic are also developed
  for the problem. The effectiveness of all the algorithms is corroborated through
  extensive computational experiments on several randomly generated instances. This
  paper is motivated by an intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance mission
  involving a single unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and a ground vehicle, where the
  vehicles must coordinate their activity in the presence of communication constraints.
  The combination of a small UAV and a ground vehicle is an ideal platform for such
  missions, since small UAVs can fly at low altitudes and can avoid obstacles or threats
  that would be problematic for the ground vehicle alone. This paper addresses the
  coordinated routing problem involving these two vehicles and presents an algorithm
  to obtain an optimal solution for this problem, fast heuristics to obtain good feasible
  solutions, and also a transformation method to transform any instance of this cooperative
  vehicle routing problem to an instance of the one-in-a-set traveling salesman problem.
