abstract: A novel GPS denied routing problem for UAVs is described, where the UAVs
  cooperatively navigate through a restricted zone deployed with noncommunicating
  Unattended Ground Sensors (UGS). The routing algorithm presenting in this paper
  ensures the UAVs maintain strict contact with at least one UGS, which allows the
  UGS act as beacons for relative navigation eliminating the need for dead reckoning.
  This problem is referred to as the Communication Constrained UAV Routing Problem
  (CCURP). Two architectures for cooperative navigation of two or three UAVs are considered.
  For the two UAV problem, a 92$frac 92$-approximation algorithm is developed. The
  three UAV problem is transformed into a one-in-a-set Traveling Salesman Problem
  (TSP), which is solved as a regular asymmetric TSP using existing methods after
  applying a second transformation. Computational results corroborating the performance
  bounds are presented.
