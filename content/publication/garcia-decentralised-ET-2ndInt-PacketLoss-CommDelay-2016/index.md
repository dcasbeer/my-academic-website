abstract: The event-triggered consensus problem with agents described by double integrator
  dynamics is addressed in this study. The authors consider the problem of non-consistent
  packet losses where the broadcast channel from one agent to its neighbours can drop
  the event-triggered packets of information, where the transmitting agent is unaware
  that the packet was not received and the receiving agents have no knowledge of the
  transmitted packet. They also consider the constraints associated with communication
  delays. In this study, they consider directed graphs, and they also relax the consistency
  on the packet dropouts and the delays. By relaxing the consistency they allow the
  dropouts and delays for a packet broadcast by one agent to be different for each
  receiving node. Under these constraints, an event-triggered consensus protocol is
  designed for the agents to achieve consensus asymptotically while reducing transmissions
  of measurements. In addition, positive inter-event times are obtained which guarantee
  that Zeno behaviour does not occur.
