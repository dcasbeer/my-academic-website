 abstract = {The event-triggered consensus problem with agents described by double integrator dynamics is addressed in this study. The authors consider the problem of non-consistent packet losses where the broadcast channel from one agent to its neighbours can drop the event-triggered packets of information, where the transmitting agent is unaware that the packet was not received and the receiving agents have no knowledge of the transmitted packet. They also consider the constraints associated with communication delays. In this study, they consider directed graphs, and they also relax the consistency on the packet dropouts and the delays. By relaxing the consistency they allow the dropouts and delays for a packet broadcast by one agent to be different for each receiving node. Under these constraints, an event-triggered consensus protocol is designed for the agents to achieve consensus asymptotically while reducing transmissions of measurements. In addition, positive inter-event times are obtained which guarantee that Zeno behaviour does not occur.},
