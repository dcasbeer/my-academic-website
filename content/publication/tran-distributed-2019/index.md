abstract: We propose a system-theoretical dynamic information fusion framework for
  heterogeneous sensor networks, where a sensor network with nonidentical node information
  roles and nonidentical node modalities is considered. Nonidentical node information
  roles allow nodes to be either active or passive in the sense that active nodes
  receive observations from a process, whereas passive nodes do not receive any information.
  Active and passive roles of nodes can be fixed or varying in time. Nonidentical
  node modalities allow active nodes to receive different classes of measurements
  from the process. For this class of sensor networks, we propose a distributed input
  and state coestimation architecture, where the time evolution of input and state
  updates of each node both depend on the local input and state information exchanges.
  Using Lyapunov theory and linear matrix inequalities, we establish stability and
  performance guarantees of the sensor network executing the proposed distributed
  coestimation architecture under local sufficient conditions.
