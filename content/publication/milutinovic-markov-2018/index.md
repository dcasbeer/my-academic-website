abstract: In this paper, a Markov inequality based switching rule is proposed to switch
  among numerically computed, time optimal controllers in a multiple vehicle intercept
  problem. Each controller is optimal for the intercept of a single vehicle, i.e.,
  for the segment of the complete time varying multiple vehicle target set. The switching
  rule guarantees that after every switch the time to the target set is shorter with
  a certain predefined probability. Furthermore, the rule guarantees that the target
  set is reached after a finite number of switches and the rule scales well with the
  number of vehicles, i.e., the segments covering the target set. The problem and
  results are illustrated by a numerical example.
