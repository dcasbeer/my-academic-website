abstract: This paper introduces a post-iteration averaging algorithm to achieve asymptotic
  optimality in convergence rates of stochastic approximation algorithms for consensus
  control with structural constraints. The algorithm involves two stages. The first
  stage is a coarse approximation obtained using a sequence of large stepsizes. Then,
  the second stage provides a refinement by averaging the iterates from the first
  stage. We show that the new algorithm is asymptotically efficient and gives the
  optimal convergence rates in the sense of the best scaling factor and ‘smallest’
  possible asymptotic variance.
