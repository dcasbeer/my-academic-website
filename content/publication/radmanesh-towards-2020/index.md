abstract: Recently, there has been a tremendous increase of interest in utilizing
  Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for a number of civilian applications. With this
  increased interest, it is imperative that these UAVs are able to operate in shared
  airspace for enhanced efficiency. Multi-UAV systems are inherently safety-critical
  systems, which means that safety guarantees must be made to ensure no undesirable
  configurations, such as collisions, occur. This paper proposes a decentralized method
  based on a Partial Differential Equation (PDE) to generate collision-free 3D trajectories
  for multiple UAVs operating in a shared airspace. This method exploits the dynamical
  properties of multi-phase fluids flowing through a porous medium by modeling the
  porosity values as a function of the risk of collision. To highlight the feasibility
  for on-board implementation, we propose propose a machine learning technique for
  obtaining computationally efficient solutions of the PDE describing flow movements
  in porous medium. This method has been compared via a simulation study to two other
  path planning strategies, centralized and sequential planning, and the advantages
  of this method are presented. Furthermore, results from an experiment using three
  UAVs have been presented to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method
  to real-world implementation.
