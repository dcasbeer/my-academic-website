abstract: The coordinated tracking problem where a group of followers intercepts a
  dynamic leader is studied. It is shown in this paper that reduction of inter-agent
  communication is obtained and improved performance is achieved when each follower
  implements dynamical models of neighbors and by using an event-triggered control
  strategy that requires each agent to send measurement updates only when necessary.
  The results in this paper consider directed graphs and the possible existence of
  cycles. Performance bounds on the tracking error have been obtained, which are functions
  of the communication topology and the event thresholds. This approach is extended
  to consider measurement noise and similar bounds are presented for this case.
