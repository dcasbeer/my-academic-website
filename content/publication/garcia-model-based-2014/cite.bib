 abstract = {The coordinated tracking problem where a group of followers intercepts a dynamic leader is studied. It is shown in this paper that reduction of inter-agent communication is obtained and improved performance is achieved when each follower implements dynamical models of neighbors and by using an event-triggered control strategy that requires each agent to send measurement updates only when necessary. The results in this paper consider directed graphs and the possible existence of cycles. Performance bounds on the tracking error have been obtained, which are functions of the communication topology and the event thresholds. This approach is extended to consider measurement noise and similar bounds are presented for this case.},
