 abstract = {This article addresses a persistent monitoring problem (PMP) that requires an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to repeatedly visit \$n\$ targets of equal priority. The UAV has limited onboard fuel/charge and must be regularly serviced at a depot. Given a fixed number of visits, \$k\$, for the UAV to the targets between successive services, the objective of the PMP is to determine an optimal sequence of visits such that the maximum time elapsed between successive visits to any target is minimized. This planning problem is a generalization of the traveling salesman problem and is NP-hard. We characterize the optimal solutions to this problem for different values of \$k\$ and develop algorithms that can compute the optimal solutions relatively fast. Numerical results are also presented to corroborate the performance of the proposed approach.},
