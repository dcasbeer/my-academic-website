abstract: This article addresses a persistent monitoring problem (PMP) that requires
  an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to repeatedly visit $n$ targets of equal priority.
  The UAV has limited onboard fuel/charge and must be regularly serviced at a depot.
  Given a fixed number of visits, $k$, for the UAV to the targets between successive
  services, the objective of the PMP is to determine an optimal sequence of visits
  such that the maximum time elapsed between successive visits to any target is minimized.
  This planning problem is a generalization of the traveling salesman problem and
  is NP-hard. We characterize the optimal solutions to this problem for different
  values of $k$ and develop algorithms that can compute the optimal solutions relatively
  fast. Numerical results are also presented to corroborate the performance of the
  proposed approach.
