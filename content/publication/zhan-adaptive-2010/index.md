abstract: Unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) are playing an increasingly prominent role
  in both military and civilian applications. We focus here on the use of multiple
  UAV agents in a target tracking application where performance is improved by exploiting
  each agent's maneuverability. Local time-delay and Doppler measurements made at
  each UAV are used as inputs to an extended Kalman filter (EKF) which tracks the
  target's position and velocity. Two simple metrics are defined to quantify the accuracy
  of the tracking algorithm, and heading feedback to the UAVs is used to minimize
  the metric and improve tracking performance. A simplified version of one of the
  algorithms that reduces computational complexity is also presented. Simulations
  demonstrate the significant improvement that results when the UAV sensors are allowed
  to be optimally positioned during tracking.
