abstract: We consider a general pursuit-evasion differential game with three or more
  pursuers and a single evader, all with simple motion (fixed-speed, infinite turn
  rate). It is shown that traditional means of differential game analysis is difficult
  for this scenario. But simple motion and min-max time to capture plus the two-person
  extension to Pontryagin’s maximum principle imply straight-line motion at maximum
  speed which forms the basis of the solution using a geometric approach. Safe evader
  paths and policies are defined which guarantee the evader can reach its destination
  without getting captured by any of the pursuers, provided its destination satisfies
  some constraints. A linear program is used to characterize the solution and subsequently
  the saddle-point is computed numerically. We replace the numerical procedure with
  a more analytical geometric approach based on Voronoi diagrams after observing a
  pattern in the numerical results. The solutions derived are open-loop optimal, meaning
  the strategies are a saddle-point equilibrium in the open-loop sense.
