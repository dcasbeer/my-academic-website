abstract: The consensus problem with general linear dynamics and undirected graphs
  is studied in this paper by means of event-triggered control strategies. A novel
  consensus protocol is proposed, where each agent implements a model of the decoupled
  dynamics of its neighbors. Under this control strategy, transmission of information
  does not occur continuously but only at discrete points in time. The approach presented
  in this paper provides both a decentralized control law and a decentralized communication
  policy. We are able to design thresholds that only depend on local information and
  guarantee asymptotic consensus. Positive inter-event times are guaranteed for particular
  cases of the linear dynamics. In an extension, a positive constant is added to the
  thresholds in order to exclude Zeno behavior for general linear dynamics. The difference
  between agents trajectories can be bounded in this case and bounds on the state
  disagreement are derived.
