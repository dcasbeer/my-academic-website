abstract: This note studies event-triggered control of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) with
  first-order integrator dynamics. It extends previous work on event-triggered consensus
  by considering limited communication capabilities through strict peer-to-peer non-continuous
  information exchange. The approach provides both a decentralised control law and
  a decentralised communication policy. Communication events require no global information
  and are based only on local state errors; agents do not require a global sampling
  period or synchronous broadcasting as in sampled-data approaches. The proposed decentralised
  event-triggered control technique guarantees that the inter-event times for each
  agent are strictly positive. Finally, the ideas in this note are used to consider
  the practical scenario where agents are able to exchange only quantised measurements
  of their states.
