 abstract = {This note studies event-triggered control of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) with first-order integrator dynamics. It extends previous work on event-triggered consensus by considering limited communication capabilities through strict peer-to-peer non-continuous information exchange. The approach provides both a decentralised control law and a decentralised communication policy. Communication events require no global information and are based only on local state errors; agents do not require a global sampling period or synchronous broadcasting as in sampled-data approaches. The proposed decentralised event-triggered control technique guarantees that the inter-event times for each agent are strictly positive. Finally, the ideas in this note are used to consider the practical scenario where agents are able to exchange only quantised measurements of their states.},
