abstract: Ensuring border security against potential threats has been a long-standing
  problem, and it becomes much more challenging for international borders due to their
  massive physical extent coupled with varied terrain. This paper considers a scenario
  in which a team of UAVs (the pursuers) attempt to prevent an intruder ground vehicle
  (the evader) from escaping through the border. The ground intruderâ€™s presence is
  made known by a laser fence positioned inside the border. Upon detection, the UAVs
  are activated and given the objective to cooperatively capture the intruder. This
  paper formulates the scenario as a zero-sum differential game whereupon all agents
  exhibit simple motion and the pursuers have a speed advantage. For cases where capture
  inside the border is possible, the payoff/cost for the pursuers/evader is the distance
  from capture to the border. The solution to the game is derived based on the geometric
  properties of the game and verified for the single-pursuer case with a border comprising
  straight-line segments. This game may contain a dispersal surface that has interesting
  practical consequences when the optimal strategies are applied in discrete time.
