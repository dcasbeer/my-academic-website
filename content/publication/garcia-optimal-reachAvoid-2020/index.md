abstract: A multi-player reach-avoid differential game with autonomous aerial robots
  in the three dimensional space is studied. Two pursuers form a team to guard a target
  against an evader with the same speed as the pursuers. This letter provides the
  complete solution of this differential game that resides within a high-dimensional
  state space. The Barrier surface is characterized and the saddle-point strategies
  are synthesized and verified. Degeneration of the two-pursuer one-evader game into
  the one-on-one case is addressed and the corresponding strategies are obtained.
  Finally, several examples illustrate the robustness properties and the guarantees
  provided by the saddle-point strategies obtained in this letter.
