abstract: In air combat, an active countermeasure against an attacking missile homing
  into a Target aircraft entails the launch of a defending missile. The Target is
  protected by the Defender, which aims to intercept the Attacker before the latter
  reaches the Target aircraft. A differential game is presented where the Target-Defender
  team strives to maximize the terminal separation between the Target and the Attacker
  at the time instant where the Attacker is intercepted by the Defender, whereas the
  Attacker strives to minimize the said separation. This paper discusses the case
  where the Defender is endowed with a positive capture radius. Optimal strategies
  for the three agents are derived and simulation examples illustrate the effectiveness
  of the proposed approach.
