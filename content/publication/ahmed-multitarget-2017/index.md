abstract: This paper considers the problem of tracking multiple moving targets on
  a road network with sparse, highly localized, unattended ground sensor data that
  are subject to clutter and missed detections. Hidden Markov models for single-target
  localization with unattended ground sensor data are first derived for road networks,
  under the assumption of perfect data association. These hidden Markov models are
  then used to solve the data association problem in the presence of clutter and missed
  detections for multitarget tracking using a Rao–Blackwellized particle filter. The
  proposed hidden Markov model tracking approach permits easy generation of accurate
  probabilistic models from a priori road network structure information, and it naturally
  enables sparse computationally efficient handling of multimodal target state uncertainties
  using both positive and negative unattended ground sensor information. The Rao–Blackwellized
  particle filter provides a fully Bayesian solution to the data association problem,
  enabling exploration of the association hypotheses space that leverages the computational
  advantages of exact hidden Markov model inference for multimodal state estimation.
  Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the hidden Markov model/Rao–Blackwellized
  particle filter on challenging multitarget tracking scenarios with high false-alarm
  and missed detection rates.
